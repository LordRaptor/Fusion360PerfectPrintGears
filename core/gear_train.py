"""Pure-Python compound gear-train search for exact clock ratios.

No `adsk`, no numpy. Works in tooth counts and exact `fractions.Fraction` ratios.
A *stage* is one external mesh of a driving gear and a driven gear; either may have
more teeth (both speed directions allowed). A train's overall ratio is the product of
its stage ratios. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-28-gear-train-calculator-design.md.
